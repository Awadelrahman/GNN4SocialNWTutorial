# GNN4SocialNWTutorial
In this quick tutorial, I am trying to show a way of using graph neural networks in social networks.

More information is on my post: https://dev.to/awadelrahman/tutorial-graph-neural-networks-for-social-networks-using-pytorch-2kf

# Dataset  
Datasets used can be found:  

I am using a bench mark datset that can be found here: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/github-social.html which is in connection with the paper: B. Rozemberczki, C. Allen and R. Sarkar. Multi-scale Attributed Node Embedding. 2019. Found here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13021


# Content
